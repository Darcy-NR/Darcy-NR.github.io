## Profile

An enthusiastic IT professional with over six years experience in software, data management and customer service. I have a demonstrated ability to create software, websites, documentation, applications, and databases.

My passion lies in data analysis, I am most in my element when I get to solve more abstract problems, and answer questions with data, mathematics, and statistics; be it on the smaller side tools such as bespoke simulations and graphing, to the higher end cutting edge of data science in machine learning and predictive analysis programs. I pride myself on being an analyst who’s also a subject matter expert in software.
